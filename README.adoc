This project uses https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[Asciidoctor.js] to render AsciiDoc as HTML inside Firefox!

== Usage

 1. Install the extension from the {ff-addon-site}[Firefox Add-ons site] or from the {latest-release}[GitHub latest release page]. When you download the `xpi` file, if Firefox downloads it instead of directly installing it, just drag and drop it on Firefox
 1. Open local or remote `.ad`, `.adoc`, `.asc`, `.asciidoc` file in Firefox
 1. Click on the _Asciidoctor Live Preview_ button in the toolbar (button with an `A` icon) to activate or deactivate the rendering.

== Local build

To manually build the extension bundle (`.xpi`) from the source you need to install the {ff-addon-sdk-install}[Firefox Add-on SDK].
Then execute the command `cfx xpi` from the add-on's directory:

 $ cfx xpi

This command will produce a file named `asciidoctorjslivepreview.xpi`. You can simply drag and drop it on Firefox to install the Add-on.
